# Bottom Action Buttons Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement to add a "Take Attendance" button alongside the existing "Add Student" floating action button in the class detail screen's Students tab. This improvement will provide users with quick access to both primary actions without navigating to the Actions tab.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to quickly take attendance from the Students tab, so that I don't have to switch between tabs to perform common actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Students tab in class detail screen THEN the system SHALL display two action buttons at the bottom
2. WHEN the Students tab is active THEN the system SHALL show "Add Student" and "Take Attendance" buttons side by side
3. WHEN user taps "Add Student" button THEN the system SHALL open the Add Student dialog
4. WHEN user taps "Take Attendance" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Take Attendance screen
5. WHEN there are no students in the class THEN the "Take Attendance" button SHALL be disabled with appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the action buttons to be easily accessible and visually distinct, so that I can quickly identify and use the correct function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Students tab THEN the system SHALL display buttons with clear icons and labels
2. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the "Add Student" button SHALL use a person_add icon
3. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the "Take Attendance" button SHALL use a how_to_reg icon
4. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL be positioned at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access
5. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient spacing between them for comfortable tapping

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the button layout to work well on different screen sizes, so that the interface remains usable on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN buttons SHALL be arranged horizontally side by side
2. WHEN viewing on larger screens THEN buttons SHALL maintain appropriate sizing and spacing
3. WHEN keyboard is visible THEN buttons SHALL remain accessible above the keyboard
4. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN buttons SHALL adapt their layout appropriately
5. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL not overlap with the student list content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want consistent behavior between the floating action button and the new bottom buttons, so that the interface feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Add Student" bottom button is tapped THEN it SHALL perform the same action as the current floating action button
2. WHEN "Take Attendance" bottom button is tapped THEN it SHALL perform the same action as the "Take Attendance" button in the Actions tab
3. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL use the same styling and theming as other app buttons
4. WHEN buttons are in loading state THEN they SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN actions complete THEN the system SHALL show the same success/error messages as existing functionality
