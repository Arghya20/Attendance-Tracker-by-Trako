# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature allows users to pin their most important or frequently used classes to the top of the home screen class list. Pinned classes will remain at the top regardless of their creation date or alphabetical order, providing quick access to priority classes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to pin my most frequently used classes to the top of the list, so that I can quickly access them without scrolling through all classes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user long-presses on a class item THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with a "Pin to Top" option
2. WHEN a user selects "Pin to Top" THEN the system SHALL move the class to the top of the list and mark it as pinned
3. WHEN a class is pinned THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator (pin icon) on the class item
4. WHEN multiple classes are pinned THEN the system SHALL maintain their relative order based on when they were pinned (most recently pinned first)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to unpin classes that I no longer need at the top, so that I can reorganize my class list based on current priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user long-presses on a pinned class item THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with an "Unpin" option
2. WHEN a user selects "Unpin" THEN the system SHALL remove the pin status and move the class back to its natural position in the list
3. WHEN a class is unpinned THEN the system SHALL remove the pin visual indicator
4. WHEN a class is unpinned THEN the system SHALL maintain the original sorting order for unpinned classes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want pinned classes to persist across app sessions, so that my preferred organization is maintained when I restart the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pins a class THEN the system SHALL store the pin status in the database
2. WHEN the app is restarted THEN the system SHALL load and display pinned classes at the top of the list
3. WHEN classes are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct order with pinned classes first, followed by unpinned classes
4. IF the database operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the current state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see a clear visual distinction between pinned and unpinned classes, so that I can easily identify which classes are prioritized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class is pinned THEN the system SHALL display a pin icon in the top-right corner of the class item
2. WHEN displaying the class list THEN the system SHALL show pinned classes with a subtle background highlight or border
3. WHEN the pin status changes THEN the system SHALL animate the visual changes smoothly
4. WHEN using different themes THEN the system SHALL ensure pin indicators are visible and accessible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to quickly toggle pin status through alternative methods, so that I have flexible ways to manage my class organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on the pin icon of a pinned class THEN the system SHALL unpin the class immediately
2. WHEN a user swipes right on an unpinned class THEN the system SHALL show a pin action button
3. WHEN a user swipes right on a pinned class THEN the system SHALL show an unpin action button
4. WHEN pin status changes through any method THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback and show a confirmation message
