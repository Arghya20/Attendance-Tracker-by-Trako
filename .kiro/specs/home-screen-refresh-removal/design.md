# Design Document

## Overview

This design involves a simple UI modification to remove the refresh IconButton from the home screen app bar while preserving the existing pull-to-refresh functionality and settings button.

## Architecture

The change affects only the HomeScreen widget's app bar configuration. No changes to the underlying data flow, providers, or refresh logic are needed since the RefreshIndicator widget already handles the refresh functionality.

## Components and Interfaces

### Modified Components

- **HomeScreen**: The app bar actions array will be updated to remove the refresh IconButton while keeping the settings IconButton.

### Unchanged Components

- **ClassProvider**: No changes needed - the loadClasses() method remains available for the RefreshIndicator
- **RefreshIndicator**: Continues to provide pull-to-refresh functionality
- **Settings functionality**: Remains unchanged in the app bar

## Data Models

No data model changes are required for this UI modification.

## Error Handling

No additional error handling is needed since we're only removing a UI element. The existing error handling for the RefreshIndicator remains intact.

## Testing Strategy

- **Widget Tests**: Verify that the app bar no longer contains a refresh button
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure pull-to-refresh functionality still works correctly
- **Visual Tests**: Confirm the app bar layout is correct with only the settings button
