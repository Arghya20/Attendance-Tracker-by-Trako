# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds tap-and-hold functionality to student list items in the class detail screen, providing users with a context menu containing edit and delete options. This enhancement improves user experience by offering an alternative interaction method similar to the existing class list functionality, while maintaining the current swipe-to-reveal actions for users who prefer that interaction pattern.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to tap and hold on any student in the student list, so that I can quickly access edit and delete options through a context menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a long press on any student list item THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with edit and delete options
2. WHEN the context menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback to confirm the interaction
3. WHEN the user taps outside the context menu THEN the system SHALL dismiss the menu without performing any action
4. WHEN the user selects "Edit student" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL open the edit student dialog
5. WHEN the user selects "Delete student" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL show the delete confirmation dialog

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the context menu to have a consistent design with the existing class context menu, so that the interface feels cohesive and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the student context menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same visual design as the existing class context menu
2. WHEN the context menu shows student information THEN the system SHALL display the student's name and relevant details in the header
3. WHEN menu items are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent icons, typography, and spacing with the class context menu
4. WHEN the delete option is shown THEN the system SHALL use destructive styling (red color) to indicate the dangerous action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want both swipe-to-reveal and tap-and-hold interactions to work simultaneously, so that I can choose my preferred interaction method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes on a student item THEN the system SHALL continue to show the existing slidable edit/delete actions
2. WHEN a user performs a long press on a student item THEN the system SHALL show the context menu without interfering with swipe functionality
3. WHEN both interaction methods are available THEN the system SHALL ensure they do not conflict with each other
4. WHEN a user performs a regular tap THEN the system SHALL continue to show student details as before

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the context menu to be accessible and responsive, so that it works well on different screen sizes and with accessibility features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the context menu is displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure proper sizing and positioning
2. WHEN the context menu is displayed on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
3. WHEN users have accessibility features enabled THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic labels and announcements
4. WHEN the context menu appears THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't extend beyond screen boundaries
5. WHEN the keyboard is visible THEN the system SHALL position the menu appropriately to avoid obstruction
