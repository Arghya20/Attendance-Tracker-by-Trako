# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the UI spacing issue where the last student in the student list is partially obscured or cut off by the bottom action buttons. The improvement will ensure proper spacing and scrolling behavior so all students are fully visible and accessible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher viewing the student list, I want adequate spacing at the bottom of the list so that I can see and interact with all students without them being hidden behind the action buttons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a student list THEN the last student SHALL have sufficient bottom padding to be fully visible above the action buttons
2. WHEN scrolling to the bottom of the student list THEN all student information SHALL be completely visible and accessible
3. WHEN the action buttons are present THEN they SHALL NOT overlap or obscure any student list items
4. WHEN there are many students in the list THEN the scrolling behavior SHALL allow viewing all students comfortably

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher using the app on different screen sizes, I want consistent spacing behavior so that the student list is properly displayed regardless of device dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on different screen sizes THEN the bottom spacing SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain visibility
2. WHEN the keyboard is visible THEN the student list spacing SHALL adjust to prevent content from being hidden
3. WHEN rotating the device THEN the bottom spacing SHALL remain appropriate for the new orientation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher interacting with students at the bottom of the list, I want to be able to tap on them easily without the action buttons interfering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping on the last student in the list THEN the tap target SHALL be fully accessible without interference from action buttons
2. WHEN performing actions on bottom students THEN the UI SHALL provide adequate touch targets and visual feedback
3. WHEN scrolling near the bottom THEN the scroll behavior SHALL be smooth and predictable
