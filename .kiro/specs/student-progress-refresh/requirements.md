# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a bug where student progress indicators (attendance percentages) do not refresh automatically after taking attendance. Currently, users must reopen the app to see updated attendance statistics, which creates a poor user experience and makes the app feel unresponsive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to see updated student attendance percentages immediately after taking attendance, so that I can verify the attendance was recorded correctly without having to restart the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes taking attendance and returns to the class detail screen THEN the student progress indicators SHALL display updated attendance percentages
2. WHEN attendance is saved successfully THEN the student list SHALL automatically refresh to show current statistics
3. WHEN the user navigates back from the take attendance screen THEN the progress indicators SHALL reflect the newly recorded attendance data
4. WHEN attendance data is updated THEN the circular progress indicators and percentage text SHALL update without requiring a manual refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the student list to stay responsive and up-to-date, so that I can trust the information displayed in the app reflects the current state of attendance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance records are modified THEN the student provider SHALL invalidate cached attendance statistics
2. WHEN returning to the class detail screen after taking attendance THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh attendance data from the database
3. WHEN attendance statistics are refreshed THEN the UI SHALL update smoothly without flickering or jarring transitions
4. WHEN the refresh occurs THEN existing scroll position and UI state SHALL be preserved where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the app to handle attendance updates efficiently, so that the refresh process doesn't cause noticeable delays or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance data is refreshed THEN the operation SHALL complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN refreshing attendance statistics THEN the system SHALL only reload data for the current class
3. WHEN multiple attendance updates occur THEN the system SHALL avoid redundant database queries
4. WHEN the refresh fails THEN the user SHALL be notified with an appropriate error message and retry option
