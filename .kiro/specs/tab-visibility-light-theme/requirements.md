# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the tab visibility issue in the class detail screen where the tab underline indicator and text are not properly visible in light theme mode. Currently, the tabs use hardcoded white colors which work well in dark theme but are invisible or poorly visible in light theme, creating a poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user using the app in light theme mode, I want the tab indicators and text to be clearly visible, so that I can easily distinguish between active and inactive tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in light theme mode THEN the active tab indicator SHALL be visible with appropriate contrast
2. WHEN the app is in light theme mode THEN the active tab text SHALL be clearly readable
3. WHEN the app is in light theme mode THEN the inactive tab text SHALL be distinguishable from active tab text
4. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN the tab colors SHALL automatically adapt to maintain proper visibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user switching between light and dark themes, I want the tab appearance to be consistent with the overall app theme, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in dark theme mode THEN the tab colors SHALL maintain the current appearance
2. WHEN the app is in light theme mode THEN the tab colors SHALL use theme-appropriate colors
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the tab colors SHALL update immediately without requiring app restart
4. WHEN viewing the Students and Analytics tabs THEN both SHALL have consistent styling within the current theme

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want the tab styling to use theme-aware colors, so that future theme changes are automatically supported without additional code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tab colors THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's theme-aware color properties
2. WHEN new themes are added in the future THEN the tabs SHALL automatically inherit appropriate colors
3. WHEN the tab styling is updated THEN it SHALL not break existing functionality
4. WHEN the tab colors are theme-aware THEN they SHALL provide sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance
