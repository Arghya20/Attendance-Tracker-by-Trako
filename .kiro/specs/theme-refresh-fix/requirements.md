# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a bug where UI elements, specifically the "Add Class" button color, do not refresh immediately when the theme or color scheme changes. Currently, users must restart the app to see the updated colors, which creates a poor user experience and makes the theme switching feature feel broken.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see UI elements update their colors immediately when I change the theme or color scheme, so that I can see the visual changes take effect without restarting the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes the color scheme in settings THEN all UI elements SHALL immediately reflect the new colors
2. WHEN a user switches between light and dark mode THEN all themed elements SHALL update their appearance instantly
3. WHEN theme changes occur THEN the "Add Class" button color SHALL update to match the new primary color
4. WHEN color scheme changes THEN all buttons, icons, and themed widgets SHALL refresh their colors without delay

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to feel responsive and consistent, so that theme changes provide immediate visual feedback across all screens and components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theme changes are applied THEN all visible UI components SHALL rebuild with new theme data
2. WHEN navigating between screens after theme change THEN all screens SHALL display consistent theming
3. WHEN theme updates occur THEN the app SHALL maintain its current state and navigation context
4. WHEN multiple themed elements are present THEN all SHALL update simultaneously without visual inconsistencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want theme changes to work reliably across different UI components, so that the theming system feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theme changes are triggered THEN floating action buttons SHALL update their colors immediately
2. WHEN color scheme changes THEN custom styled buttons (like NeoPopTiltedButton) SHALL reflect new theme colors
3. WHEN theme updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle both Material Design and custom components consistently
4. WHEN theme changes happen THEN performance SHALL remain smooth without noticeable lag or flickering
