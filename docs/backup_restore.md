1. Open the app and navigate to **Settings**
2. Tap on **"Backup & Restore"**
3. In the dialog, tap **"Create & Download Backup"**
4. The app will generate a backup file and open the share dialog
5. Choose where to save or share your backup file (email, Google Drive, etc.)

### Restoring from Backup

2. Tap on **"Backup & Restore"**
3. Tap **"Select & Restore Backup"**

## What's Included in Backups

The backup file contains all your attendance data:

## Backup File Format

- **Format**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Extension**: `.json`

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Replacement Warning
- Restoring a backup **completely replaces** all current data
- This action **cannot be undone**
- Always create a current backup before restoring an old one

### üì± Cross-Device Compatibility
- Backups work across different devices (Android to Android, etc.)
- Backup files are platform-independent
- No account or internet connection required

### üîí Privacy & Security
- Backup files are stored locally on your device
- No data is sent to external servers
- You control where backup files are stored and shared

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
- Grant storage permissions when prompted
- On Android 11+, you may need to enable "All files access" in app settings

### "Invalid Backup File" Error
- Ensure the file is a valid JSON backup created by this app
- Check that the file hasn't been corrupted or modified

### "Failed to Create Backup" Error
- Ensure you have sufficient storage space
- Check that the app has necessary permissions

### App Doesn't Show Restored Data
- **Restart the app completely** after restoring
- Force-close and reopen the app

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Create backups regularly, especially before major changes
2. **Safe Storage**: Store backup files in multiple locations (cloud storage, email, etc.)
3. **Test Restores**: Occasionally test that your backups can be restored successfully
4. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for backup files (e.g., "attendance_backup_2024_01_15.json")

## Technical Details

- **Database Version Compatibility**: Automatically handled
- **File Size**: Varies based on data (typically 1KB - 10MB)
- **Compression**: None (human-readable JSON)
